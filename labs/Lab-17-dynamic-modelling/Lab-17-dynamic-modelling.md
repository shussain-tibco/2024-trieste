## 17.1. Create a simple geometry

We will build a very simple patient model in `egs_chamber`. The body will
consist of a large rectangle of water, the lungs will be modelled as two
cylinders. One of the lungs will have a small, spherical tumour. We will score
dose in the tumour. The x-direction corresponds to right/left, y is
superior/inferior, and z is anterior/posterior.

Create a new input file, starting with the body (rectangular box of water):

```ruby
:start geometry definition:
    :start geometry:
        library  = egs_box
        name     = empty_body
        box size = 35 150 20
        :start media input:
            media = water
        :stop media input:
    :stop geometry:
:stop geometry definition:
```

Next, use cone stack geometries to model the lungs as cylinders (20 cm height, 7
cm radius). Choose the axis input parameters so that the centre of the lung is
at (8, 30, 0) cm:

```ruby
    :start geometry:
        name    = lung_R
        library = egs_cones
        type    = EGS_ConeStack
        axis    = 8 20 0 0 1 0    # starts at (8, 20, 0) and builds up in +y direction
        :start layer:
            thickness    = 20
            top radii    = 7
            bottom radii = 7
            media        = lung
        :stop layer:
    :stop geometry:
```

Add another similar geometry to define the other lung (`axis` will need to be
updated appropriately). Next, define a 2 cm sphere of water centred at (5,
30,Â 0) cm:
```ruby
    :start geometry:
        name     = tumour
        library  = egs_spheres
        midpoint = 8 30 0
        radii = 2
        :start media input:
            media = water
        :stop media input:
    :stop geometry:
```

Once you have added the sphere, you should have four geometries defined (body,
two lungs, one tumour). Use an envelope to inscribe both lungs inside the body:

```ruby
    :start geometry:
        library = egs_genvelope
    name    = body_lungs
    base geometry = empty_body
    inscribed geometries = lung_L lung_R
    :stop geometry:
```

Both lungs can be inscribed at the same time because the inscribed geometries do
not overlap with each other. However, the tumour must be inscribed in a separate
step because it does overlap one of the lungs. Therefore, use another envelope
geometry to inscribe the tumour into the above composite geometry. Once both
envelope geometries are done, use a transformation to shift the body so that the
lung tumour is at (0,0,0). The origin location corresponds to isocentre in our
simulation.

```ruby
    :start geometry:
        name        = body_noRot
        library     = egs_gtransformed
        my geometry = body_noRot_noShift
        :start transformation:
            translation = -8 -30 0   # negative of the lung tumour position!
        :stop transformation:
    :stop geometry:
```

The body is now complete. Use `egs_view` to verify your simulation geometry. You
can adjust transparency or use clipping planes to view the different regions.
Ensure that the lung tumour is at (0,0,0).

Add a `media definition` input block to define the three media that will be used
in this simulation (water, lung, air). We will be simulating a 6 MV photon beam,
so the upper energies must be at least that high:

```ruby
:start media definition:

    ae = 0.521
    ap = 0.010
    ue = 6.511
    up = 6

    ### water
    :start water:
        # these files are found in: HEN_HOUSE/pegs4/density_corrections/compounds/
        density correction file = water_liquid
    :stop water:

    ### lung
    :start lung:
        density correction file = lung_inflated_icru_1986
    :stop lung:

    ### air
    :start air:
        density correction file = air_dry_nearsealevel
    :stop air:

:stop media definition:
```

## 17.2. Rotate the geometry

In this lab, we want to simulate a four-field lung treatment consisting of three
fields delivered with the couch at 0 degrees (gantry angles = 0, 90, 180
degrees), and one field delivered with a 45 degree couch rotation (gantry angle
= 90 degrees). Gantry rotation will be modelled using `egs_dynamic_source`,
whereas couch (i.e., patient) rotation will be modelled using
`egs_dynamic_geometry`. We will work on the `egs_dynamic_geometry` first:

```ruby
    :start geometry:
        name        = body
        library     = egs_dynamic_geometry
        my geometry = body_noRot      # name of existing geometry defined above
        synchronize motion = yes         # so that we can sync with the source!
        :start motion:
            # control point = time(1) xtrans(1) ytrans(1) ztrans(1) xrot(1) yrot(1) zrot(1)
            # units of cm and degrees
            control point 1 = 0.00 0 0 0 0 0 0
            control point 2 = 0.25 0 0 0 0 0 0
            control point 3 = 0.25 0 0 0 0 0 0
            control point 4 = 0.50 0 0 0 0 0 0
            control point 5 = 0.50 0 0 0 0 0 0
            control point 6 = 0.75 0 0 0 0 0 0
            control point 7 = 0.75 0 0 0 0 0 45      # rotation about the z-axis = couch kick!
            control point 8 = 1.00 0 0 0 0 0 45
        :stop motion:
    :stop geometry:
```

We want to synchronize patient motion with source motion, so we specify
`synchronize motion = yes`. For the synchronization to work properly, the number
of control points and their associated time index will need to match the source
definition. We supply a list of eight control points (two per field). Equal beam
weighting is achieved by specifying equally-spaced time points. For the first
six control points, none of the `egs_dynamic_geometry` translation or rotation
parameters are changing. These correspond to control points where only the
gantry angle is changing, and gantry rotation will be handled later on using
`egs_dynamic_source`. The control point numbers are not required and can be
omitted.

Synchronized motion can also be used with `egs_beam_source` where the motion of
the geometry in an `egs++` simulation can be synchronized with jaws and/or MLCs
components in a BEAMnrc simulation.

Because we are simulating static fields (i.e., no couch or gantry motion while
the beam is on), we change control point parameters without incrementing the
time index. For example, between control points 6 and 7, the rotation of the
patient about the z-axis changes from 0 to 45 degrees while the time index
remains at 0.75. Between control points 7 and 8, the time index increases by
0.25 while the z-axis rotation remains at 45 degrees, thus simulating beam
delivery with a 45 degree couch rotation.

It is important to note that egs++ always applies rotations first. Therefore, it
would be incorrect to incorporate the (-8, -30, 0) translation into the control
point definitions above.

To help visualize particle tracks, and to provide realistic surroundings for
your patient, define a box of air (side length = 250 cm). Use another envelope
geometry to place the patient inside the air box. This is the final geometry
that we will use to calculate dose.

### Question

- What is the region number of the lung tumour? Use `egs_view` to verify your
  answer.

## 17.3. Rotate the source

In the source definition block, define a collimated source originating from 100
cm away from isocentre = (0,0,0) along the z-axis. The target shape should be
defined such that we get a $6\times6$ cm$^2$ square at isocentre. We will use a
6 MV linac photon spectrum that comes with the EGSnrc distribution:

```ruby
    :start source:
        name      = my_source_static
        library   = egs_collimated_source
        charge    = 0   # photons

        ### point source 100 cm away on +z axis, directed in +z direction
        :start source shape:
            type     = point
            position = 0 0 -100
        :stop source shape:

        ### collimation to 5x5 cm^2 square field at isocentre
        :start target shape:
            library   = egs_rectangle
            rectangle = -2.5 -2.5 2.5 2.5
        :stop target shape:

        ### 6 MV spectrum
        :start spectrum:
            type = tabulated spectrum
            spectrum file = /Users/patriciaoliver/EGSnrc/HEN_HOUSE/spectra/egsnrc/mohan6.spectrum
        :stop spectrum:
    :stop source:
```

The source that we have defined above is static. We will use
`egs_dynamic_source` to make it rotate, to simulation gantry rotation. Add
another source within your source definition block:

```ruby
    :start source:
        library = egs_dynamic_source
        name = my_source
        source name = my_source_static     # name of a previously defined source
        synchronize motion = yes           # sync with geometry!
        :start motion:
            # beam centred on tumour, which is at isocentre:
            control point 1 = 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0.0
            control point 2 = 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0.25
            etc...
            # Note: same number of CPs as egs_dynamic_geometry, also same time points
                    # --> necessary for synchronization
        :stop motion:
    :stop source:
```

The format for the ith control point is: `control point i = xiso[i] yiso[i]
ziso[i] dsource[i] theta[i] phi[i] phicol[i] time[i]`.  `dsource` is the
distance from isocentre to source origin. With no rotations, +ve dsource is
along the negative z-axis.`theta` is the angle of rotation of `dsource` about
the y-axis (positive values define clockwise rotations relative to the negative
z-axis). `Phi` is the angle of rotation of `dsource` about the z-axis (positive
values define clockwise rotations relative to the x-axis. `Phicol` is the angle
of rotation of the source about negative `dsource` (positive values define
clockwise rotations). All values are in cm and degrees.

We define `dsource` = 0 because we already set the source-to-axis distance to
100 cm when we defined the static version of the collimated source. For
`egs_dynamic_source`, the transformations are applied in the following order:
(1) `dsource` translation, (2) all rotations, (3) isocentre translation.

Complete the definition of all eight control points. Remember that the number of
control points and their associated time index will need to match those of the
`egs_dynamic_geometry` that we defined earlier. Based on the coordinate system
that we have defined for our patient, `theta` corresponds to gantry angle.
`Phicol` and `Phi` can remain at zero throughout.

As a final step, define `simulation source = my_source` so that the correct
source (the dynamic one) is used in the simulation.

### Question

- What would you change if you wanted to simulate gantry rotation while the beam
  is on?

## 17.4. Complete the input file

Add the other necessary components of the input file: run control, rng
definition, scoring options, variance reduction, and MC transport parameters:

```ruby
## Run control
:start run control:
    ncase = 1e7    # use fewer e.g., 1e5 for track generation
:stop run control:

## Random numbers
:start rng definition:
    initial seeds = 34 171
:stop rng definition:

## Scoring
:start scoring options:
    :start calculation geometry:
    geometry name = final
    cavity regions = 4
    cavity mass = 1            # not true but we're doing relative comparisons anyway
    cavity geometry = tumour   # for range-based Russian Roulette
    :stop calculation geometry:
:stop scoring options:

## Variance reduction
:start variance reduction:
    cs enhancement = 0       # no XCSE here
    :start range rejection:
        rejection = 32       # survival probability is one over this
        Esave     = 0.521    # no range rej but Russian Roulette for E > Esave
        cavity geometry = tumour             # dummy (see scoring options block above)
        rejection range medium = lung        # should be least dense medium in geom
    :stop range rejection:
:stop variance reduction:

## Transport parameters
:start MC transport parameter:
    Global Ecut = 0.521        # cutoff energy for electrons, incl. rest mass, in MeV
    Global Pcut = 0.01         # cutoff energy for photons, in MeV
:stop MC transport parameter:

## Ausgab objects
## comment this out once you are done with particle tracks
:start ausgab object definition:
   :start ausgab object:
       library = egs_track_scoring
       include time index = yes          ### default
       stop scoring = 20000
   :stop ausgab object:
:stop ausgab object definition:
```

For variance reduction techniques, we will use range-based Russian Roulette with
a survival probability of 1/32 (feel free to experiment with other values).
Photon cross-section enhancement is not used, although defining a XCSE region
surrounding the lung tumour could be useful for improving efficiency.

For particle tracks with dynamic geometries and sources, `include time index =
yes` is the default. This allows us to see particle tracks and geometry motion
as a function of time in `egs_view`.

## 17.5. Run the simulation

First, run the simulation for a small number of histories (e.g., 1e5) to make
sure it is working. View the particle tracks in `egs_view` to confirm that the
beam directions and positioning are correct. The beams should all be aimed
toward the lung tumour. You can adjust the time index (slider bar or numerical
entry) to view certain points in time. The time window input controls the size
of the time bin that you are viewing (e.g., set to 1.0 to see all particle
tracks at once). The number of time steps can also be adjusted.

Next, run the simulation for a longer number of histories (1e7).

### Questions

- What is the dose to the lung tumour?

Repeat the simulation with the lungs set to water. Do not change anything else
in the input file.

- What is the dose to the lung tumour when the lungs are water?

Imagine that your clinic has switched from using a treatment planning system
(TPS) that does not account for tissue heterogeneities to one that does. How
will lung tumour dose change as a result of this? Assume that the prescription
dose specified in the TPS has not changed.

- Which simulation is more efficient?

- How would you simulate gantry rotation while the beam is on if the gantry
  rotates through 0/360 degrees?
