## 2. Requirements

Consider the following requirement checklist to deliver the EGSnrc course.

### 2.1. Hardware, classroom

- [ ] A workstation and projector (16:9) for the presenter.
- [ ] Power bars for the presenters (front of class).
- [ ] HDMI cable or adapter to connect to the projector.
- [ ] Laser pointer, ideally with slide controls.
- [ ] Internet access (at least to [github.com](https://github.com) and [slides.com](https://slides.com)).

### 2.2. Hardware, laboratory

- [ ] A workstation and projector (16:9) for the presenter.
- [ ] Power bars for the presenters (front of laboratory)
- [ ] HDMI cable or adapter to connect to the projector.
- [ ] Laser pointer, ideally with slide controls.
- [ ] Internet access (at least to [github.com](https://github.com) and [slides.com](https://slides.com)).
- [ ] A laboratory computer, 27 inch HDMI monitor, mouse and keyboard for each **pair** of students.
- [ ] Spare power bars, 27 inch HDMI monitors, mice and keyboards for instructors (back of the laboratory).
- [ ] Laboratory arranged so that there is space for instructors to walk behind the students to provide help.
- [ ] Extra chairs for instructors to sit on while helping students.
- [ ] 3 extra desk space, chairs, HDMI

### 2.3. Software

- [ ] The [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) software version 7.0 is installed on each computer, with bridged internet access. Check the following:
  - [ ] There is internet connectivity from within the VM.
  - [ ] The VM can fullscreen and the whole desktop can be viewed without scrollbars.
  - [ ] It is responsive, and does not freeze.
- [ ] A `Lubuntu` linux Virtual Box (VB) is provided by the EGSnrc instructors.
- [ ] The provided VB is loaded on each laboratory computer, and verified to work _before_ course.

### 2.4. Github

The intent is to use this repository to discuss and build the courses, and then
deliver content to the live
[EGSnrc-courses/](https://github.com/EGSnrc-courses) repo for participants
during any given course. Different EGSnrc course may be built concurrently, on
separate [branches](https://github.com/EGSnrc-courses/development/tree/main/branches/all).
Ensure your pull requests are against the appropriate branch.

- [ ] Students shall `git clone` and configure [EGSnrc](https://github.com/nrc-cnrc/EGSnrc.git) on the VB, at the start of the course.
- [ ] This EGSnrc courses [development](https://github.com/EGSnrc-courses/development/) _private_ repository serves as the building area for course material.
- [ ] A separate [course repository](https://github.com/EGSnrc-courses) _private_ repository will serve as the course home directory for students
- [ ] Students are invited as *collaborators* once they participate in an EGSnrc course.
- [ ] Students are encouraged to interact and ask questions under [Discussions](https://github.com/ftessier/EGSnrc-course/discussions).
- [ ] EGSnrc itself is included as a submodule, *for reference only.*

## 3. Logistics

- [ ] Confirm the number of students as soon as possible.
- [ ] Confirm amount to cover travel, accommodation, and daily subsistance allowance.
- [ ] Obtain access to the lecture and lab spaces on the day before the start of the course.
- [ ] Confirm a technician on site the day before the start of the course, for testing.
- [ ] Ensure technical support is available for the duration of the course.
